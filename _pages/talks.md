Each year, I aim to present my research at national and international conferences. This is a great opportunity not only to share my findings, but also to network, meet new and old colleagues, and learn about all the cool science being done in the field. A few of my talks have been recorded, and I'm sharing them here. I'm also including some media appearances I've made over the year, because effective science communication is essential for any scientist, no matter what field. 

For a complete list of talks, poster presentations, and media appearances, check out my CV.
